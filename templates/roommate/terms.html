Roommate reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Advertisement which Roommate, in its reasonable opinion, considers to be in breach of these Terms or otherwise objectionable or harmful to Roommate’s reputation.
						</p>
						<p>
							You understand and agree that Roommate does not act as an insurer or as an agent with power to enter into contracts for you as a Host. If a Potential Guest requests a booking of your Property, any agreement you enter into with that Potential Guest is between you and the Potential Guest and Roommate is not a party to that agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Roommate serves as the limited agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Host and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Host in accordance with the Terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you create an Advertisement, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Property, including requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to rent your Property. Any Member wishing to rent Properties included in Advertisements with such requirements must meet these requirements. We do not guarantee that any Member claiming to meet any requirements in fact does so and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether or not a Member does meet your requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the “Hosts” section of the Services.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are a Host, Roommate may make certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to rent your Property to. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are solely responsible for your own acts and omissions. Roommate does not represent or guarantee that any person you decide to rent your Property to, whether or not on the basis of any tools made available by Roommate, is qualified or suitable to rent your Property.
						</p>
						<p style="color:blue"><b>BOOKINGS</b></p>
						<p>
							If you are a Host and a booking is requested for your Property via the Services, you may be required to either confirm or reject the booking within [insert duration] of when the booking is requested or the booking request may be automatically cancelled. When a booking is requested via the Services, we will share with you (a) the first and last name of the Potential Guest who has requested the booking, and (b) a link to the Potential Guest’s Roommate Account profile page so that you can view the information on that page before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of a Property within such 24-hour period, any amounts collected by Roommate for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Potential Guest’s credit card and any pre-authorisation of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Potential Guest, Roommate will send you an email message via the Services confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Services.
						</p>
						<p>
							The fees displayed in each Advertisement are comprised of the Rental Fees and the Service Charges. Where applicable, Tax may be charged in addition to the Rental Fees and Service Charges, such will clearly be stated in the Advertisement. The Rental Fees, Service Charges and applicable Tax are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and payable by a Guest solely relating to an Host’s Property which are actually collected by Roommate are the “Rental Fees”. Please note that it is the Host and not Roommate which determines the Rental Fees. The Rental Fees may include a cleaning fee or additional costs, at the Host’s discretion.
						</p>
						<p>
							Hosts, not Roommate, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed bookings and making available any Properties reserved through the Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with an Host for the booking of a Property, you agree and understand that you will be entering into a contract with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Property imposed by the Host, all of which will be notified to you before you are required to commit to that contract. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Roommate, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such contracts, that Roommate is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its obligations hereunder to pay Rental Fees and Late Charges to the applicable Host, Roommate disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Roommate is not a party to the agreement between you and the Host, Roommate acts as the Host’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Host. Upon your payment of amounts to Roommate which are due to the Host, your payment obligation to the Host for such amounts is fulfilled, and Roommate is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Roommate’s Service Fees, to the Host as per the payment terms agreed by and between Roommate and the Host. In the event that Roommate does not remit any such amounts to Host, such Host will have recourse for such amounts only against Roommate.
						</p>
						<p>
							You, the Guest, agree to pay Roommate the Rental Fees and Late Charges for any booking requested in connection with your Roommate Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Host. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Host’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Roommate, on behalf of the Host, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorisation via your credit card/debit card/post dated cheque/net banking for the Rental Fees or (ii) charge your credit card/debit card a nominal amount, not to exceed [insert amount] to verify your card. Once Roommate receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Roommate will collect the Rental Fees and Late Charges in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Roommate cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Roommate’s collection of the Rental Fees or Late Charges, and Roommate disclaims all liability in this regard.
						</p>
						<p>
							In connection with a requested booking, a Prospective Guest will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Roommate or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Roommate for Rental Fees and Late Charges for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Roommate Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Website –e.g. by credit card/debit card/ post dated cheque/net banking. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Roommate or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Services. You also authorize Roommate to charge your credit card or use any of the post dated cheques provided as per the terms and conditions agreed between the Guest and the Host in the event of damage caused to a Property as contemplated in paragraph 17. If you are directed to Roommate’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and, if applicable their privacy policy, before using the services.Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.

For all Security Deposits included in an Advertisement for a confirmed booking of a Property, Roommate will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Host, use its reasonable endeavours to obtain a pre-authorisation of the Guest’s credit card in the amount the Host determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of the Guest’s rent of the Property. Roommate will also use its reasonable endeavours to address Hosts’ requests and claims related to such Security Deposits, but Roommate is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.
